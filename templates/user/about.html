After independence many schemes were started for the development of the country.
      In which the requirement of technicians was paramount‚ whose fulfillment was possible only through technical institutions.
      But at that time‚ there was acute shortage of technical institutions in the country.<br>
      In such a situation‚ the establishment of some new technical institution was under the consideration of government.
      Keeping in view these requirements‚ the ultimate visionary‚ Purvanchal vikas parish Brahmalin Mahant Digvijay Nath Ji
      Maharaj established Maharana Pratap Shiksha Prishad‚
      whose purpose was to remove the backwardness of the eastern region and to educate the people. <br>On 15-07-1956‚ the
      proposal was passed to start overseer classes
      in Maharana Pratap Engineering Institute. The contribution of late Dr. Hari Prasad shahi in shaping of this auspicious
      idea of Mahant Ji has been unforgottable.
      The Dr. Shahi completed the admission procedure of first year of Maharana Pratap Engineering Institute in 1956-57 and
      gave admission to 230 students in civil Engineering.
      At that time‚ the school was at initial stage and it had not its own bulding Due to this school was started in Prachary
      Bhavan of Maharana Pratap Degree College.
